//What is the meaning of "throwing the error" ?
//It means that we need to throw an exception to signal that some kind of error occured.
//We need to handle that exception by catching it.

//To handle the error situations in the program we are using try/catch/finally statement.

// try{
// Block of code to try
// }catch(e){
// Block of code to handle errors
// }
// finally{
// Block of code to be executed without any concern of try/catch result.
// }
